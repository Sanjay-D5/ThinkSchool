This platform that we are talking about is called the Open Credit enables network or OCEN!! and this will solve the most critical problem for the MSMEs of India which is the CREDIT GAP problem!! and if you think its no big deal at all, take a look at this graph, in the past 10 years, the MSME sector of India has contributed to 30% of our GDP, in the past 3 years more than 40% of our exports came from MSMEs and most importantly, this segment of India alone employs over 100 Million people in the country!!! and yet when covid happened, most of the companies could not get loan because of which they could pay their rent, they could not pay their employees and eventually, they had to take loans from Money lenders at 18‚Äì30% interest!!! because of this even today, many MSMEs in India are still struggling to recover their profits!!! and this points towards a very very critical problem in the economy of India!',
